Welcome to the GPCRchimeraDB documentation!
===========================================

This documentation will help you understand how to interact with `GPCRchimeraDB <https://bio2byte.be/gpcrchimeradb/>`_
and explain how its data was retrieved or generated.

But first, a reminder of GPCRchimeraDB's goals:

1. Centralize previously designed chimeric GPCRs available in the literature in a single location.
2. Describe both chimeric and natural GPCRs at the sequence, structural, and biophysical levels.
3. Support the design of novel chimeric GPCRs to make more GPCRs druggable.

The documentation is organized into two sections:

* :ref:`user-docs`
* :ref:`about-docs`
