Download Data
=============

You can download data at multiple locations on the database:


-  **The "Entries" page**: You can select the entry/entries you are interested in and download
    -   Their entire description (sequence, structural and biophysical level) in JSON format.
    -   Their biophysical profile in TSV format.

-  **The Entry page of a GPCR of interest**: At the top of the entry page of a GPCR of interest (banner), you can downlaoad:
    -   Its sequence in FASTA format.
    -   Its 3D structures or models in PDB format.
    -   Its biophysical profile in TSV format.
    -   Its entire description (sequence, structural and biophysical level) in JSON format.
    -   The entire description (sequence, structural and biophysical level) in JSON format of a residue of interest by selecting that residue in the Sequence Properties section. 

-  **The Alignment page**: After aligning your proteins of interest, you can download the alignment in FASTA format.


-  **COMING SOON: GPCRchimeraDB GitHub**: Donwload all raw data (JSON format) of the Entries, the master Multiple Sequence Alignments (FASTA format) and the code that was used to retrieve, parse and format the data. The code behind the database is also available there.
