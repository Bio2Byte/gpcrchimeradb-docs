Entry types & Descriptors
=========================

On GPCRchimeraDB, two types of entries can be found:

-   The Chimera Entries which were obtained through an extensive literature search.
-	The Natural Entries which are all reviewed class A mammalian GPCRs available on InterPro (IPR017452). These include the parent GPCRs of the chimeras as well as GPCRs not used in chimeric design before. This will allow to consider novel parent combinations in the future.

Chimeric GPCRs

.. Again, the EC side parent refers to the parent at the extracellular side of the chimera while the IC side parent is the parent at the intracellular side.
.. Depending on the design strategy and aim, the IC side parent is not necessarly contributing all IC loops to the chimera. The same is true for the EC side parent and the EC loops.
.. The EC side parent can provide some IC loops. The IC side parent on the contrary will never be found at the EC side. This is because the chimeras described on GPCRchimeraDB all have cutting points
.. at the end of the Transmembrane regions (TMs) / start of the IC loops and end of the IC loops / start of the TMs. Designs with

Overview scheme
---------------

Below is a Miro board summarizing the information contained on GPCRchimeraDB. 
It explains how the source of information varies depending on whether the entry is a natural or chimeric GPCR.

For natural GPCRs, all information on GPCRchimeraDB is based on their UniProt ID or Sequence. 
For chimeric GPCRs, the information is based solely on their Sequence.
