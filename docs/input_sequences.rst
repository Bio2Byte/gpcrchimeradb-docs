Again, the EC side parent refers to the parent at the extracellular side of the chimera while the IC side parent is the parent at the intracellular side.
Depending on the design strategy and aim, the IC side parent is not necessarly contributing all IC loops to the chimera. The same is true for the EC side parent and the EC loops.
The EC side parent can provide some IC loops. The IC side parent on the contrary will never be found at the EC side. This is because the chimeras described on GPCRchimeraDB all have cutting points
at the end of the Transmembrane regions (TMs) / start of the IC loops and end of the IC loops / start of the TMs. Designs with
