Data describing the Entries
===========================

Every Entry on GPCRchimeraDB has an "Entry page". Depending on the Entry, the amount of information varies.
The organization of the "Entry page" is the same for chimeric and natural entries.
You can easily navigate between the sections of the "Entry page" using the Sidebar.
In this section we discuss the different sections of the "Entry page" and the data they contain.


Overview
---------
In this section, a general description of the entries is given.
For Natural GPCRs, the information was directly retrieved form diverse databases as we will discuss below.
For Chimeric GPCRs, the information is the concatenation of the information of the two parents of the chimera.
It is always 1st the info from the extracellular (EC) parent and then 2nd from the intracellular (IC) parent.
The information is combined with either a "_" or a "&".

-   Type of GPCR:
Either "Natural GPCR" or "Chimeric GPCR". The differences is explained in :ref:`input_sequences`.
