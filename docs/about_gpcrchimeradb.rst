About GPCRchimeraDB
===================

GPCRchimeraDB offers:
-   Natural & Chimeric GPCRs
-   Data at sequence, structural and biophysical level
-   Visualization tools
-   Analysis tools

GPCRchimeraDB is the only database to describe chimeric GPCRs and their parents at such an extend.

Finally, GPCRchimeraDB's goals are the following:

1. Centralize previously designed chimeric GPCRs available in the literature in a single location.
2. Describe both chimeric and natural GPCRs at the sequence, structural, and biophysical levels.
3. Support the design of novel chimeric GPCRs to make more GPCRs druggable.
