About GPCRchimeraDB
===================

GPCRchimeraDB offers:

-   Natural & Chimeric GPCRs
-   Data at sequence, structural and biophysical level
-   Visualization tools
-   Analysis tools

GPCRchimeraDB is the only database to describe chimeric and natural GPCRs at such an extend and to enable the study the chimera's features in relation to their parents' features.

Finally, GPCRchimeraDB's goals are the following:

1. Centralize previously designed chimeric GPCRs available in the literature in a single location.
2. Describe both chimeric and natural GPCRs at the sequence, structural, and biophysical levels.
3. Support the design of novel chimeric GPCRs to make more GPCRs druggable.
